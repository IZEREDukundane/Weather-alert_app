## 🌦️ Introduction
### Why I Built This
As someone who appreciates the balance between technology and real-world applications, I wanted to create a tool that serves a tangible purpose. Living in Rwanda, where weather conditions can shift unexpectedly, I realized the importance of staying informed about real-time weather alerts. This project was born from a personal need to create something meaningful, blending my knowledge of software engineering with my background in pharmacy—because just like medication adherence, staying prepared for the weather is crucial for well-being.

## 🎢 Challenges & Learnings
Building this project wasn’t just about fetching weather data. The biggest challenge was **real-time notifications**. Web Push API can be tricky, especially when dealing with permission handling across browsers. Debugging notifications and ensuring they arrive at the right time was a learning curve. Another challenge was handling **API rate limits**, which required implementing local caching to reduce excessive requests.
